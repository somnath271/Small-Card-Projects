# Small Card Projects

This repository contains a series of simple card projects created using HTML and CSS. It's a small project intended for learning and practicing basic web development skills. Each card is in its respective folder (card1, card2, etc.) and contains individual HTML and CSS files.

## Project Overview

Each card project follows a similar structure with an HTML file (`index.html`) and a CSS file (`style.css`) to create visually appealing cards.

### Card Structure

- **card1/**
  - **index.html**: HTML structure for the first card.
  - **style.css**: Styles and layout for the first card.

- **card2/**
  - **index.html**: HTML structure for the second card.
  - **style.css**: Styles and layout for the second card.

- **card3/**
  - **index.html**: HTML structure for the third card.
  - **style.css**: Styles and layout for the third card.

- **card4/**
  - **index.html**: HTML structure for the fourth card.
  - **style.css**: Styles and layout for the fourth card.

- **card5/**
  - **index.html**: HTML structure for the fifth card.
  - **style.css**: Styles and layout for the fifth card.
